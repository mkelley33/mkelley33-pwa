## MDX: writing a blog post in <a href="https://mdxjs.com/" target="markdown-component-era" rel="noopener">markdown for the component era</a>

### Reasons why MDX with Next.js, React, and TypeScript

- Next.js <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation" target="nextjs-ssg" rel="noopener">uses
  SSG (Static Site Generation)</a> to create pages from MDX at build time

- Blog faster writing MDX than <a href="https://byby.dev/js-markdown-libs" target="mdx-alternatives" rel="noopener">alternative approaches</a> with HTML or other blogging platforms
- <a href="https://mdxjs.com/#mdx-in-short" target="mdx-in-short" rel="noopener">Read about the benefits of MDX</a>
- React components can be used in MDX
- <a href="https://prismic.io/blog/what-is-typescript" target="prismic-what-is-typescript" rel="noopener">TypeScript reasons</a>: reduces bugs, documents code, enhances code quality, and makes code more maintainable

## 1. Getting Started: Create a Next.js app

This post shows you how to create your own Next.js blog using MDX markdown with React and TypeScript.

### Pre-requisites and recommendations

**Required**: a terminal and preferably some command-line knowledge

### 1.1 **Install the project basics**

- <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script" target="install-nvm" rel="noopener">Install nvm</a> to get the latest version of node.js LTS
- `node -v > .nvmrc`. I'm using v20.8.0
- `mkdir my-nextjs-blog` wherever you keep projects directory
- `cd my-nextjs-blog`
- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="install-vs-code">Install Visual Studio Code</a>
- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line" target="vscode-command-line" rel="noopener">Launch Visual Studio Code</a>: `code .`
- `⌘ + j` to open a terminal in your editor
- `git init`
- `npx gitignore node`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m 'Add initial files`

### 1.2 **Install Next.js**

```shell showLineNumbers
$ npx create-next-app

Need to install the following packages:
create-next-app@14.1.0

## 2. Install and configure the blog dependencies

### 2.1 Add Contentlayer, next-contentlayer

#### 2.1.1 Why you need Contentlayer for Next.js

From <a href="https://contentlayer.dev/" target="content-layer" rel="noopener">Contentlayer</a>:

"Contentlayer is a content SDK that validates and transforms your content into type-safe JSON data you can easily import into your application."

We'll use it to transform our MDX markdown files into JSON that Next.js can consume.

#### 2.1.2 Installing Contentlayer and next-contentlayer with Next.js 14.1.0

**The problem** is that next-contentlayer doesn't yet support Next.js 14.1.0

So to install next-contentlayer with Next.js 14.1.0 you can do the following:

```shell
$ npm i -D contentlayer@latest next-contentlayer@latest --legacy-peer-deps
```

At the time of this writing that translates to versions `0.3.4` being installed.

- However, <a href="https://github.com/shadcn/next-contentlayer/issues/21" target="next-contentlayer-21" rel="noopener">there is an open issue on GitHub</a>.
- There's also an <a href="https://github.com/shadcn/next-contentlayer/pull/24" target="next-contentlayer-pr-24" rel="noopener">approved PR out there</a>
 that fixes one of the issues with `next/image` in an MDX component.

### 2.2 Pause for npm dependency care

This is around the time when I peg everything to patch versions
**Note**: I _do update_ to minor versions too, just more carefully, and less frequently than patch versions.

So open the `package.json` in your root directory and do the following:

- Move your cursor to the first caret ^ and press ⌘ + d (or ctrl + d) until all the carets are selected.
- Press delete, then press ~ to peg everything to the patch version

You might see that versions of some packages may look something like this `~18` now.
I prefer to see the exact version listed in my package.json and that will put us on
the same page. So run the following and copy the exact versions from the output of `npm ls`
into your package.json:

**Optional**:

```shell
$ npm i -g npm-check-updates
$ npx ncu -ut patch
$ npm i
$ git add package.json package-lock.json
$ git commit -m 'Update dependencies'
```

Now all of your dependencies in package.json should be the latest patch versions.

### 2.3 Configure next-contentlayer

Put the following code in your `next.config.mjs` that was generated by `npx create-next-app`:

```javascript
import { withContentlayer } from 'next-contentlayer';

/** @type {import("next").NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
};

export default withContentlayer(nextConfig);
```
