- React components can be used in MDX
- <a href="https://prismic.io/blog/what-is-typescript" target="prismic-what-is-typescript" rel="noopener">TypeScript reasons</a>: reduces bugs, documents code, enhances code quality, and makes code more maintainable

## 1. Getting Started: Create a Next.js app

This post shows you how to create your own Next.js blog using MDX markdown with React and TypeScript.

### Pre-requisites and recommendations

**Required**: a terminal and preferably some command-line knowledge

### 1.1 **Install the project basics**

- <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script" target="install-nvm" rel="noopener">Install nvm</a> to get the latest version of node.js LTS
- `node -v > .nvmrc`. I'm using v20.8.0
- `mkdir my-nextjs-blog` wherever you keep projects directory
- `cd my-nextjs-blog`
- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="install-vs-code">Install Visual Studio Code</a>
- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line" target="vscode-command-line" rel="noopener">Launch Visual Studio Code</a>: `code .`
- `⌘ + j` to open a terminal in your editor
- `git init`
- `npx gitignore node`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m 'Add initial files`

### 1.2 **Install Next.js**

## 2. Install and configure the blog dependencies

### 2.1 Add Contentlayer, next-contentlayer

#### 2.1.1 Why you need Contentlayer for Next.js

From <a href="https://contentlayer.dev/" target="content-layer" rel="noopener">Contentlayer</a>:

"Contentlayer is a content SDK that validates and transforms your content into type-safe JSON data you can easily import into your application."

We'll use it to transform our MDX markdown files into JSON that Next.js can consume.

#### 2.1.2 Installing Contentlayer and next-contentlayer with Next.js 14.1.0

**The problem** is that next-contentlayer doesn't yet support Next.js 14.1.0

So to install next-contentlayer with Next.js 14.1.0 you can do the following:

```shell
$ npm i -D contentlayer@latest next-contentlayer@latest --legacy-peer-deps
```

At the time of this writing that translates to versions `0.3.4` being installed.

- However, <a href="https://github.com/shadcn/next-contentlayer/issues/21" target="next-contentlayer-21" rel="noopener">there is an open issue on GitHub</a>.
- There's also an <a href="https://github.com/shadcn/next-contentlayer/pull/24" target="next-contentlayer-pr-24" rel="noopener">approved PR out there</a>
 that fixes one of the issues with `next/image` in an MDX component.
